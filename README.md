# WineNeuralNet
After reading about neural nets for 3 weeks I decided to make my own.  This is a very basic (incomplete!) neural net that takes information 
from a wine database and predicts how well someone would like it based on the amount of sugar, alcohol and pH levels are present in the wine. 

I wanted to "hard code" a neural net going off of theory to develop a more concrete foundation before I switched to tensorflow.  

I used red wine database courtesy of https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

Some code is borrowed from Welch Labs excellent neural net demystified series:

Future goals:
Implement a much better version of gradient descent.
